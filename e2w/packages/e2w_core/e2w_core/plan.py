"""Causal Planner outputs — the two vector types fed downstream (NOT masks).

Implements: ``architecture.md §A.2`` 【2】 and ``proposal.md §2.6.2``. The planner
parses ``do(X=x)`` and emits two *different* things (do not conflate them):

* **region-query vectors** — sparse concept pointers → the mask decoder
  (``masks.py``); they say *which regions get hit*, they are NOT pixel-aligned.
* **edit-plan tokens** — continuous content condition → the gated renderer; they
  say *what the changed region should look like* (the ``[EDIT]`` path,
  Sa2VA-plan change B).

Pixel masks are decoded later — the LLM never emits a mask directly (its tokens
are sparse and not pixel-aligned). Both vector types are differentiable and
trained end-to-end (no RL).
